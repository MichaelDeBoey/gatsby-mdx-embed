# gatsby-mdx-embed

With `gatsby-mdx-embed` you can embed media content from providers like Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and a number of others directly in `.mdx` ... **no imports required**

## 👁️ Preview

- [Live Demo](https://gatsby-mdx-embed.netlify.com/)

## 🚀 Getting started

### Install

```
npm install @pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed
```

### Install peer dependencies

```
npm install @mdx-js/react gatsby-plugin-mdx
```

### Setup

```js
// gatsby.config
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [`@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed`]
  ...
}
```

gatsby-mdx-embed automatically injects an `MdxProvider`. If it's the first and / or only plugin that uses this method you shouldn't have any clashes.

However if you're using a theme or some other plugin that uses `.mdx` you may need to switch the order of the plugins.

A note on using multiple `MdxProvider`(s) directly from [@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi)

> Multiple providers will merge the components object. **Last provider wins**
