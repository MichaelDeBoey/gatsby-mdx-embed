# All your favorite providers in one place!

Add `gatsby-mdx-embed` to your `gatsby-config.js` then use the components in your `.mdx` files!

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [`@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed`]
  ...
}
```

## No import required!

Because `gatsby-mdx-embed` is a plugin, to use it just pop a component in your `.mdx` file and; et voila!

```js
// some-mdx-file.mdx
